<details><summary>Southern Ground Hornbill</summary>
  <br>
Zoo Boise has one southern ground hornbill in the plaza:
  <br>
- Toogle is a favorite of guests, volunteers, and staff! He was hand-raised due to special circumstances, so he loves showing off his treasures and food (typically a mouse or chick) to shocked guests. He makes a distinctive booming sound, which can be heard in the surrounding areas.
