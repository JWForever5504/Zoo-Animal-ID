<details><summary>Styan's Red Pandas</summary>
  <br>
Zoo Boise has two Styan's red pandas:
  <br>
- Jasper is the male, and is missing some front teeth, leading to his tongue sticking out most of the time.
  <br>
- Stevie is the female, and is a bit defensive of her indoor area, often not allowing Jasper to come in. She is most frequently near the back of her exhibit or inside.
